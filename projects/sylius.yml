    Sylius is an Open Source eCommerce Framework based on Symfony full stack.
    The technology is constructed from fully decoupled components (bundles in Symfony glossary), 
    which means that every feature (products catalog, shipping engine, promotions system...) 
    can be used in any other application.
    It integrates easily with existing systems and guarantees fast time to market. 
    Built with testing in mind and a great care of code quality, 
    Sylius is exceptionally flexible and easy to use. Its wide and friendly community 
    is always ready to help with any issue. Finally, it is fully documented.
